### Description
The S3 Redshift Application Template continuously scans the directory and imports the data from S3 to Redshift database.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performance and can perform as fast as the network bandwidth allows.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source S3 credentials, bucket name, directory to scan and destination Redshift credentials, table name.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.
