### Description
The Kafka to HDFS Filter with Transform Application continuously reads json string messages from configured kafka topic(s), filters based on the filter criteria, applies given transformations on the specified fields and writes each message as a json string in HDFS file(s). 

To customize this application, user can configure it to run it with different schema at the launch time. 
- The application scales linearly with the number of Kafka brokers and Kafka topics.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can process faster than Kafka broker can produce per topic.
- It is extremely easy to add custom logic to get your business value without worrying about connectivity and operational details of Kafka consumer and HDFS writer.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source Kafka broker list, topic list, input schema, filter criteria and destination HDFS path, filename.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.

Import the application from DataTorrent AppHub and launch it for the desired functionality. Follow the tutorial videos or walkthrough document below to launch the template and add custom logic to process the data during ingestion.
