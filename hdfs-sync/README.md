### Description
The HDFS to HDFS Sync Application Template continuously ingests files as blocks from one Hadoop cluster to another retaining one-to-one file traceability.
- The application scales linearly with number of block readers.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can perform as fast as the network bandwidth allows.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source and destination HDFS paths.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.

Download the application from DataTorrent AppHub and launch it to ingest data from one Hadoop cluster to another. Follow the tutorial videos or walkthrough document below to launch the template and run it.
