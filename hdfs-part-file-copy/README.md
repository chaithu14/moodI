### Description
The HDFS to HDFS part file copy Application Template continuously ingest files as blocks from one Hadoop cluster to another for backup or further processing without worrying about the compaction.
- The application keeps the same data at destination but creates part files instead of complete file. 
- The application scales linearly with number of block readers.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can perform as fast as the network bandwidth allows.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source and destination HDFS paths.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.
